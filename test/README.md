# Kernel Stress Tests

This repository contains a set of stress tests for various kernel subsystems, such as dentries, shared memory, tmpfs mounts, and kernel memory allocations.  
It is intended for testing kernel behavior under heavy load and edge conditions.

---

## Directory Structure
- `run_all_tests.sh` – Wrapper script to execute all stress tests.
- `stress_dentry.sh` – Stress test for dentries.
- `stress_kmalloc_user.sh` – Stress test for kernel memory allocation.
- `stress_shm` / `stress_shm.c` – Shared memory stress test (compiled binary + source).
- `stress_tmpfs_mounts.sh` – Stress test for tmpfs mount/unmount operations.
- `logs/` – Logs generated by the stress tests.
- `leak_module/` – Supporting kernel module for leak detection (if required by some tests).

---

## Prerequisites
- **Linux system** with required kernel features enabled.
- **Root privileges** (most tests require root to interact with the kernel).
- **GCC/Make** (for building `stress_shm` if you need to recompile it).
- Optional: Kernel module build tools if using `leak_module/`.

---

## Running All Stress Tests

To execute **all available stress tests** in one go:
```bash
sudo ./run_all_tests.sh
